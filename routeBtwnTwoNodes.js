/*

A directed graph consistst of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect it to other nodes:

Node = {
  value:'a',
  edges: [node1, node2, ...]
}
Given an acyclic graph (a graph with no loops) like the following: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph)

Or a graph with cycles like the following: (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Directed.svg)

Find whether there is a route between two nodes of the graph.
