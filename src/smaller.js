/*

Write

function smaller(arr)
that given an array arr, you have to return the amount of numbers that are smaller than arr[i] to the right.

For example:

smaller([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) === [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
smaller([1, 2, 0]) === [1, 1, 0]
If you've completed this one and you feel like testing your performance tuning of this same kata, head over to the much tougher version How many are smaller than me II?

function smaller(arr = []) {
  // for each value in the array
    // for each of the following values
      // count the number of values that are less than the current value
      // add the count to the output array 
  return arr;
